# 1D array is a collection of elements of the same data type.
# 1D array is also known as a vector or a list.
# 1D array is a linear data structure.

#example
# 1D array of integers
# 1D array of floating point numbers
# 1D array of characters
# 1D array of strings

#code examples
# 1D array of integers
array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(array1)

# 1D array of floating point numbers
array2 = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5]  
print(array2)

# 1D array of characters
array3 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
print(array3)

# 1D array of strings
array4 = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']
print(array4)


#Accessing elements in a 1D array
#To access an element in a 1D array, you need to specify the index.
#The index specifies the position of the element in the array.
#The index is zero-based.
#The index is an integer.
#The index is enclosed in square brackets.

#example
#Access the element at index 0
print(array1[0])

#Access the element at index 1
print(array1[1])
