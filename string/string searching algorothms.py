#string searching algorithms
#String searching algorithms are algorithms that search for a substring in a string.
#There are several string searching algorithms, including the brute force algorithm, the Boyer-Moore algorithm, and the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.
#The brute force algorithm is the simplest string searching algorithm.
#The brute force algorithm compares the substring with the string character by character.
#The brute force algorithm has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the
#substring.
#The Boyer-Moore algorithm is a more efficient string searching
#algorithm than the brute force algorithm.
#The Boyer-Moore algorithm uses a heuristic to skip characters in the string that do not match the substring.
#The Boyer-Moore algorithm has a time complexity of O(n+m), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the substring.
#The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is another efficient string searching algorithm.
#The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm uses a prefix function to skip characters in the string that do not match the substring.
#The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm has a time complexity of O(n+m), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the substring.
#The Rabin-Karp algorithm is another string searching algorithm that uses hashing to search for a substring in a string.
#The Rabin-Karp algorithm has a time complexity of O(n+m), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the substring.
#The Aho-Corasick algorithm is another string searching algorithm that uses a trie data structure to search for multiple substrings in a string.
#The Aho-Corasick algorithm has a time complexity of O(n+m), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the substring.
#The Z algorithm is another string searching algorithm that uses a Z array to search for a substring in a string.
#The Z algorithm has a time complexity of O(n+m), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the substring.
#The string searching algorithms are used in text editors, search engines, and other applications that require searching for a substring in a string.
#The string searching algorithms are used in text editors, search engines, and other applications that require searching for a substring in a string.
